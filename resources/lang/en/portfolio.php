        This portfolio features most of the work that I do in my spare
        time, as well as at university. It is therefore a collection
        of simple single page apps, dummy websites, blogs and in general
        cool things that I have built based mostly on tutorials e.g.
        build a clock using JavaScript.

         Throughout my time at University I hope to grow this section
         so that I can showcase the achievements that I make during my
         studies, and I also hope to be able to upload any presentation
         material that I produce for a few talks that I have done and
         include them here as part of the portfolio.
