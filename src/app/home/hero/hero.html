            <p>
              I'm Stanley Clark. I love to focus on the expanding frontier of
              web development. I'm interested in all things front end, including
              using webpack, angular2, react, npm, and lots more. Not limiting
              myself to just pure technologies I see the importance of proper
              SEO for web sites and the importance of conversion rates vs
              user satisfaction balance on any website.
            </p>
            <h2 class="about-section-title">CURRENT FOCUS</h2>
            <p>
              Currently I am busy with expanding my knowledge by participating
              in a master's degree at the Eindhoven University of Technology in
              Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Web Science. The
              degree fits perfectly into my background of wanting to be more
              design focussed and user centric even while having a technical
              background.
            </p>
            <p>
              This area of focus is a great advantage in my work as a front end
              web developer for StudyPortals. I work on a high traffic website
              in a search team as a scrum master, thus I always enhance my
              knowledge with the help of my team mates and can implement important
              enhancements, most recently a visual regression test setup as part
              of our continuous deployment process.
